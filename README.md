# Tabbed-Smileys

The mod adds a "tabbed interface" to the post form. The smileys are organized in "tabs": the first tab contains all the smileys configured to appear in the post form, the "additional tabs" are defined based on the number of rows of smileys present in the popup (one row = one tab). You can add new rows of smileys from the admin panel, in **set smiley order**.<br />
With this mod it is possible to use all the available smileys without leave the posting browser window to reach the popup and keep low the number of smileys shown over the post form.

If you want to help, feel free!<br />
The mod is now available at github:<br />

---------------------------------------

## Configuration

The number of tabs is defined by the number of rows of smileys in the popup: every row corresponds to a tab.

Doing like in the picture will create a third tab: the "basic" (with all the smileys in the post form), the first line of the popup (the :'( in the picture) and the newly added.<br />
It's possible to change the tab a smiley belongs to by changing the position both in "edit smileys" or in "set smiley order".<br />
It's also possible to define a custom name for each tab and change the css style directly in the admin panel, section "set smiley order".
